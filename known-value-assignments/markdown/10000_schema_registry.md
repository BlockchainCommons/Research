| 10145 | `schema:Claim` | class | https://schema.org/Claim | A [[Claim]] in Schema.org represents a specific, factually-oriented claim that could be the [[itemReviewed]] in a [[ClaimReview]]. The content of a claim can be summarized with the [[text]] property. Variations on well known claims can have their common identity indicated via [[sameAs]] links, and summarized with a [[name]]. Ideally, a [[Claim]] description includes enough contextual information to minimize the risk of ambiguity or inclarity. In practice, many claims are better understood in the context in which they appear or the interpretations provided by claim reviews.    Beyond [[ClaimReview]], the Claim type can be associated with related creative works - for example a [[ScholarlyArticle]] or [[Question]] might be [[about]] some [[Claim]].    At this time, Schema.org does not define any types of relationship between claims. This is a natural area for future exploration.    |
| 10146 | `schema:ClaimReview` | class | https://schema.org/ClaimReview | A fact-checking review of claims made (or reported) in some creative work (referenced via itemReviewed). |

| 10157 | `schema:ComicIssue` | class | https://schema.org/ComicIssue | Individual comic issues are serially published as     	part of a larger series. For the sake of consistency, even one-shot issues     	belong to a series comprised of a single issue. All comic issues can be     	uniquely identified by: the combination of the name and volume number of the     	series to which the issue belongs; the issue number; and the variant     	description of the issue (if any). |
| 10158 | `schema:ComicSeries` | class | https://schema.org/ComicSeries | A sequential publication of comic stories under a     	unifying title, for example "The Amazing Spider-Man" or "Groo the     	Wanderer". |

| 10163 | `schema:CompleteDataFeed` | class | https://schema.org/CompleteDataFeed | A [[CompleteDataFeed]] is a [[DataFeed]] whose standard representation includes content for every item currently in the feed.  This is the equivalent of Atom's element as defined in Feed Paging and Archiving [RFC 5005](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5005), for example (and as defined for Atom), when using data from a feed that represents a collection of items that varies over time (e.g. "Top Twenty Records") there is no need to have newer entries mixed in alongside older, obsolete entries. By marking this feed as a CompleteDataFeed, old entries can be safely discarded when the feed is refreshed, since we can assume the feed has provided descriptions for all current items. |
| 10164 | `schema:CompoundPriceSpecification` | class | https://schema.org/CompoundPriceSpecification | A compound price specification is one that bundles multiple prices that all apply in combination for different dimensions of consumption.

A [[ConstraintNode]] can be described using [[constraintProperty]] and [[numConstraints]]. These constraint properties can serve a     variety of purposes, and their values may sometimes be understood to indicate sets of possible values rather than single, exact and specific values. |

If the facility is being made available from an established [[Pharmacy]], [[Hotel]], or other       non-medical organization, multiple types can be listed. This makes it easier to re-use existing schema.org information       about that place, e.g. contact info, address, opening hours. Note that in an emergency, such information may not always be reliable.        |
| 10189 | `schema:CreateAction` | class | https://schema.org/CreateAction | The act of deliberately creating/producing/generating/building a result out of the agent. |

| 10192 | `schema:CreativeWorkSeries` | class | https://schema.org/CreativeWorkSeries | A CreativeWorkSeries in schema.org is a group of related items, typically but not necessarily of the same kind. CreativeWorkSeries are usually organized into some order, often chronological. Unlike [[ItemList]] which is a general purpose data structure for lists of things, the emphasis with CreativeWorkSeries is on published materials (written e.g. books and periodicals, or media such as TV, radio and games).\n\nSpecific subtypes are available for describing [[TVSeries]], [[RadioSeries]], [[MovieSeries]], [[BookSeries]], [[Periodical]] and [[VideoGameSeries]]. In each case, the [[hasPart]] / [[isPartOf]] properties can be used to relate the CreativeWorkSeries to its parts. The general CreativeWorkSeries type serves largely just to organize these more specific and practical subtypes.\n\nIt is common for properties applicable to an item from the series to be usefully applied to the containing group. Schema.org attempts to anticipate some of these cases, but publishers should be free to apply properties of the series parts to the series as a whole wherever they seem appropriate.      |
| 10193 | `schema:CreditCard` | class | https://schema.org/CreditCard | A card payment method of a particular brand or name.  Used to mark up a particular payment method and/or the financial product/service that supplies the card account.\n\nCommonly used values:\n\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#AmericanExpress\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#DinersClub\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#Discover\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#JCB\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#MasterCard\n* http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#VISA         |

These can include online columns, travel and food guides, TV and radio shows, blogs and other independent Web sites. [[CriticReview]]s are typically more in-depth and professionally written. For simpler, casually written user/visitor/viewer/customer reviews, it is more appropriate to use the [[UserReview]] type. Review aggregator sites such as Metacritic already separate out the site's user reviews from selected critic reviews that originate from third-party sources. |

For work in progress guidelines on Coronavirus-related markup see [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ikaGCKxo50rRM7nvKSlbUpjyIk2WMQd3IkB1lItlrM/edit#).  The motivating scenario for SpecialAnnouncement is the [Coronavirus pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic), and the initial vocabulary is oriented to this urgent situation. Schema.org expect to improve the markup iteratively as it is deployed and as feedback emerges from use. In addition to our usual [Github entry](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2490), feedback comments can also be provided in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fpdFFxk8s87CWwACs53SGkYv3aafSxz_DTtOQxMrBJQ/edit#).   While this schema is designed to communicate urgent crisis-related information, it is not the same as an emergency warning technology like [CAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol), although there may be overlaps. The intent is to cover the kinds of everyday practical information being posted to existing websites during an emergency situation.  Several kinds of information can be provided:  We encourage the provision of "name", "text", "datePosted", "expires" (if appropriate), "category" and "url" as a simple baseline. It is important to provide a value for "category" where possible, most ideally as a well known URL from Wikipedia or Wikidata. In the case of the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, this should be "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2019-20\_coronavirus\_pandemic" or "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81068910".  For many of the possible properties, values can either be simple links or an inline description, depending on whether a summary is available. For a link, provide just the URL of the appropriate page as the property's value. For an inline description, use a [[WebContent]] type, and provide the url as a property of that, alongside at least a simple "[[text]]" summary of the page. It is unlikely that a single SpecialAnnouncement will need all of the possible properties simultaneously.  We expect that in many cases the page referenced might contain more specialized structured data, e.g. contact info, [[openingHours]], [[Event]], [[FAQPage]] etc. By linking to those pages from a [[SpecialAnnouncement]] you can help make it clearer that the events are related to the situation (e.g. Coronavirus) indicated by the [[category]] property of the [[SpecialAnnouncement]].  Many [[SpecialAnnouncement]]s will relate to particular regions and to identifiable local organizations. Use [[spatialCoverage]] for the region, and [[announcementLocation]] to indicate specific [[LocalBusiness]]es and [[CivicStructure]]s. If the announcement affects both a particular region and a specific location (for example, a library closure that serves an entire region), use both [[spatialCoverage]] and [[announcementLocation]].  The [[about]] property can be used to indicate entities that are the focus of the announcement. We now recommend using [[about]] only for representing non-location entities (e.g. a [[Course]] or a [[RadioStation]]). For places, use [[announcementLocation]] and [[spatialCoverage]]. Consumers of this markup should be aware that the initial design encouraged the use of [[about]] for locations too.  The basic content of [[SpecialAnnouncement]] is similar to that of an [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) or [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)) feed. For publishers without such feeds, basic feed-like information can be shared by posting [[SpecialAnnouncement]] updates in a page, e.g. using JSON-LD. For sites with Atom/RSS functionality, you can point to a feed with the [[webFeed]] property. This can be a simple URL, or an inline [[DataFeed]] object, with [[encodingFormat]] providing media type information, e.g. "application/rss+xml" or "application/atom+xml".  |
| 10795 | `schema:Specialty` | class | https://schema.org/Specialty | Any branch of a field in which people typically develop specific expertise, usually after significant study, time, and effort. |
| 10796 | `schema:SportingGoodsStore` | class | https://schema.org/SportingGoodsStore | A sporting goods store. |

| 10804 | `schema:State` | class | https://schema.org/State | A state or province of a country. |
| 10805 | `schema:Statement` | class | https://schema.org/Statement | A statement about something, for example a fun or interesting fact. If known, the main entity this statement is about can be indicated using mainEntity. For more formal claims (e.g. in Fact Checking), consider using [[Claim]] instead. Use the [[text]] property to capture the text of the statement. |
| 10806 | `schema:StatisticalPopulation` | class | https://schema.org/StatisticalPopulation | A StatisticalPopulation is a set of instances of a certain given type that satisfy some set of constraints. The property [[populationType]] is used to specify the type. Any property that can be used on instances of that type can appear on the statistical population. For example, a [[StatisticalPopulation]] representing all [[Person]]s with a [[homeLocation]] of East Podunk California would be described by applying the appropriate [[homeLocation]] and [[populationType]] properties to a [[StatisticalPopulation]] item that stands for that set of people. The properties [[numConstraints]] and [[constraintProperty]] are used to specify which of the populations properties are used to specify the population. Note that the sense of "population" used here is the general sense of a statistical population, and does not imply that the population consists of people. For example, a [[populationType]] of [[Event]] or [[NewsArticle]] could be used. See also [[Observation]], where a [[populationType]] such as [[Person]] or [[Event]] can be indicated directly. In most cases it may be better to use [[StatisticalVariable]] instead of [[StatisticalPopulation]]. |
| 10807 | `schema:StatisticalVariable` | class | https://schema.org/StatisticalVariable | [[StatisticalVariable]] represents any type of statistical metric that can be measured at a place and time. The usage pattern for [[StatisticalVariable]] is typically expressed using [[Observation]] with an explicit [[populationType]], which is a type, typically drawn from Schema.org. Each [[StatisticalVariable]] is marked as a [[ConstraintNode]], meaning that some properties (those listed using [[constraintProperty]]) serve in this setting solely to define the statistical variable rather than literally describe a specific person, place or thing. For example, a [[StatisticalVariable]] Median_Height_Person_Female representing the median height of women, could be written as follows: the population type is [[Person]]; the measuredProperty [[height]]; the [[statType]] [[median]]; the [[gender]] [[Female]]. It is important to note that there are many kinds of scientific quantitative observation which are not fully, perfectly or unambiguously described following this pattern, or with solely Schema.org terminology. The approach taken here is designed to allow partial, incremental or minimal description of [[StatisticalVariable]]s, and the use of detailed sets of entity and property IDs from external repositories. The [[measurementMethod]], [[unitCode]] and [[unitText]] properties can also be used to clarify the specific nature and notation of an observed measurement.  |

| 10816 | `schema:SuperficialAnatomy` | class | https://schema.org/SuperficialAnatomy | Anatomical features that can be observed by sight (without dissection), including the form and proportions of the human body as well as surface landmarks that correspond to deeper subcutaneous structures. Superficial anatomy plays an important role in sports medicine, phlebotomy, and other medical specialties as underlying anatomical structures can be identified through surface palpation. For example, during back surgery, superficial anatomy can be used to palpate and count vertebrae to find the site of incision. Or in phlebotomy, superficial anatomy can be used to locate an underlying vein; for example, the median cubital vein can be located by palpating the borders of the cubital fossa (such as the epicondyles of the humerus) and then looking for the superficial signs of the vein, such as size, prominence, ability to refill after depression, and feel of surrounding tissue support. As another example, in a subluxation (dislocation) of the glenohumeral joint, the bony structure becomes pronounced with the deltoid muscle failing to cover the glenohumeral joint allowing the edges of the scapula to be superficially visible. Here, the superficial anatomy is the visible edges of the scapula, implying the underlying dislocation of the joint (the related anatomical structure). |

For example, a net metering rebate that pays $10/kWh, up to $1,000:</p>     {         "@type": "UnitPriceSpecification",         "price": 10,         "priceCurrency": "USD",         "referenceQuantity": 1,         "unitCode": "DO3",         "unitText": "kw/h",         "maxPrice": 1000,         "description": "$10 / kwh up to $1000"     } <p>[[LoanOrCredit]]: Use for incentives that are loan based. For example, a loan of $4,000 - $50,000 with a repayment term of 10 years, interest free would look like:</p>     {         "@type": "LoanOrCredit",         "loanTerm": {                 "@type":"QuantitativeValue",                 "value":"10",                 "unitCode": "ANN"             },         "amount":[             {                 "@type": "QuantitativeValue",                 "Name":"fixed interest rate",                 "value":"0",             },         ],         "amount":[             {                 "@type": "MonetaryAmount",                 "Name":"min loan amount",                 "value":"4000",                 "currency":"CAD"             },             {                 "@type": "MonetaryAmount",                 "Name":"max loan amount",                 "value":"50000",                 "currency":"CAD"             }         ],     }  In summary: <ul><li>Use [[QuantitativeValue]] for absolute/percentage-based incentives applied on the price of a good/service.</li> <li>Use [[UnitPriceSpecification]] for incentives based on a per-unit basis (e.g. net metering).</li> <li>Use [[LoanOrCredit]] for loans/credits.</li> </ul>. |

It is not meaningful to use a 'true' value for this property alongside a transitTimeLabel (for [[DeliveryTimeSettings]]) or shippingLabel (for [[ShippingRateSettings]]), since this property is for use with unlabelled settings. |
| 11677 | `schema:isVariantOf` | property | https://schema.org/isVariantOf | Indicates the kind of product that this is a variant of. In the case of [[ProductModel]], this is a pointer (from a ProductModel) to a base product from which this product is a variant. It is safe to infer that the variant inherits all product features from the base model, unless defined locally. This is not transitive. In the case of a [[ProductGroup]], the group description also serves as a template, representing a set of Products that vary on explicitly defined, specific dimensions only (so it defines both a set of variants, as well as which values distinguish amongst those variants). When used with [[ProductGroup]], this property can apply to any [[Product]] included in the group. |

The various components (ICD, OID, OPI) are joined with a colon character (ASCII `0x3a`). Note that many existing organization identifiers defined as attributes like [leiCode](https://schema.org/leiCode) (`0199`), [duns](https://schema.org/duns) (`0060`) or [GLN](https://schema.org/globalLocationNumber) (`0088`) can be expressed using ISO-6523. If possible, ISO-6523 codes should be preferred to populating [vatID](https://schema.org/vatID) or [taxID](https://schema.org/taxID), as ISO identifiers are less ambiguous. |

A maintainer is a [[Person]] or [[Organization]] that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on "upstream" sources. When [[maintainer]] is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a [[Dataset]], it is always  possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The [[isBasedOn]] property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work.        |

| 11792 | `schema:measuredProperty` | property | https://schema.org/measuredProperty | The measuredProperty of an [[Observation]], typically via its [[StatisticalVariable]]. There are various kinds of applicable [[Property]]: a schema.org property, a property from other RDF-compatible systems, e.g. W3C RDF Data Cube, Data Commons, Wikidata, or schema.org extensions such as [GS1's](https://www.gs1.org/voc/?show=properties). |

| 11796 | `schema:measurementTechnique` | property | https://schema.org/measurementTechnique | A technique, method or technology used in an [[Observation]], [[StatisticalVariable]] or [[Dataset]] (or [[DataDownload]], [[DataCatalog]]), corresponding to the method used for measuring the corresponding variable(s) (for datasets, described using [[variableMeasured]]; for [[Observation]], a [[StatisticalVariable]]). Often but not necessarily each [[variableMeasured]] will have an explicit representation as (or mapping to) an property such as those defined in Schema.org, or other RDF vocabularies and "knowledge graphs". In that case the subproperty of [[variableMeasured]] called [[measuredProperty]] is applicable.      The [[measurementTechnique]] property helps when extra clarification is needed about how a [[measuredProperty]] was measured. This is oriented towards scientific and scholarly dataset publication but may have broader applicability; it is not intended as a full representation of measurement, but can often serve as a high level summary for dataset discovery.   For example, if [[variableMeasured]] is: molecule concentration, [[measurementTechnique]] could be: "mass spectrometry" or "nmr spectroscopy" or "colorimetry" or "immunofluorescence". If the [[variableMeasured]] is "depression rating", the [[measurementTechnique]] could be "Zung Scale" or "HAM-D" or "Beck Depression Inventory".   If there are several [[variableMeasured]] properties recorded for some given data object, use a [[PropertyValue]] for each [[variableMeasured]] and attach the corresponding [[measurementTechnique]]. The value can also be from an enumeration, organized as a [[MeasurementMetholdEnumeration]]. |

| 11823 | `schema:mobileUrl` | property | https://schema.org/mobileUrl | The [[mobileUrl]] property is provided for specific situations in which data consumers need to determine whether one of several provided URLs is a dedicated 'mobile site'.  To discourage over-use, and reflecting intial usecases, the property is expected only on [[Product]] and [[Offer]], rather than [[Thing]]. The general trend in web technology is towards [responsive design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) in which content can be flexibly adapted to a wide range of browsing environments. Pages and sites referenced with the long-established [[url]] property should ideally also be usable on a wide variety of devices, including mobile phones. In most cases, it would be pointless and counter productive to attempt to update all [[url]] markup to use [[mobileUrl]] for more mobile-oriented pages. The property is intended for the case when items (primarily [[Product]] and [[Offer]]) have extra URLs hosted on an additional "mobile site" alongside the main one. It should not be taken as an endorsement of this publication style.      |

For symmetry   In the case of a [[Review]], the property describes the [[itemReviewed]] from the perspective of the review; in the case of a [[Product]], the product itself is being described. Since product descriptions  tend to emphasise positive claims, it may be relatively unusual to find [[negativeNotes]] used in this way. Nevertheless for the sake of symmetry, [[negativeNotes]] can be used on [[Product]].  The property values can be expressed either as unstructured text (repeated as necessary), or if ordered, as a list (in which case the most negative is at the beginning of the list). |
| 11847 | `schema:nerve` | property | https://schema.org/nerve | The underlying innervation associated with the muscle. |

The *speakable* property can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator' values:  1.) *id-value* URL references - uses *id-value* of an element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of *speakable* has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned.  2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, e.g. via class attribute. Use the [[cssSelector]] property.  3.)  XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content).
