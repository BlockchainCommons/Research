## Abstract

This document defines **Unit**, the Known Value at code point 0, which serves as both a type and its sole inhabitant. Unit positively asserts deliberate emptiness—that a position carries zero informational content and must not be replaced with any other value. In Gordian Envelope, Unit enables envelopes whose meaning is conveyed entirely by their assertions, without requiring a subject identifier such as a DID or XID. This specification distinguishes Unit from null (absence) and Unknown (value exists but is not known), clarifying its role as a first-class semantic primitive for intentional vacuity.

## Introduction

Programming languages and data-interchange formats have long grappled with representing "nothing." Most solutions conflate several distinct concepts: *absence* (no value is currently present), *unknown* (a value must exist but is not known), and *emptiness* (a value that deliberately carries no information). This conflation leads to ambiguity—does a `null` field mean the data was never provided, that it was intentionally cleared, or that emptiness itself is the only possible answer?

Type theory offers a cleaner distinction through the [unit type](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/unit+type): a type with exactly one inhabitant. Unlike `null`, which denotes absence, the unit value positively asserts that this position is occupied—by the unique value that carries zero bits of information. A function returning unit is not "returning nothing"; it is returning the only possible value of a type that encodes no choices.

[Known Values](bcr-2023-002-known-value.md) reserves code point 0 for **Unit**, bringing this type-theoretic concept into the semantic layer. Unit enables structured data formats like Gordian Envelope to distinguish between "this slot is empty on purpose" and "this slot has *and can have* no meaningful value." The distinction matters: an envelope whose subject is Unit declares that its meaning lies entirely in its assertions, not in some missing identifier.

## The Unit Type and Value

Code point 0 denotes **Unit**—a special entry that is *simultaneously* a class **and** its single inhabitant, written as the empty string in single quotes as for all known values:

```
''
```

**Semantics:**

**Unit** *positively* asserts that “nothing is or can be conveyed in this position.” It is **not** a stand-in for a missing, null, or still-to-be-determined value, nor a marker that something *ought* to or *might* be here later. By using **Unit** you are saying, *precisely*, that this position carries zero informational content, *and* that it would be incorrect to replace it with any other value.

Contrast this with `'Unknown'` (codepoint 17), which indicates that *some* value exists but is not known, and with explicit null constructs (e.g., JavaScript or CBOR `null`), which signify *absence* rather than *deliberate emptiness.*

**Language parallels:**

- **Rust:** both the unit type and the value are written `()`
- **C / C++:** the *type* `void` plays the same role in the type system, but there is **no inhabitant value** (functions simply return to the caller)
- **Java:** the primitive return type `void`; boxed analogue `java.lang.Void` is a reference type whose only legal inhabitant is `null`
- **Python:** the singleton value `None`, whose type is `types.NoneType`

## Usage in Gordian Envelope

A primary use of **Unit** in Gordian Envelope is to represent the subject of the envelope when it is the *assertions* of the envelope that convey its entire meaning, and there is no obvious subject like a DID or XID about which to make the assertions. For example, an envelope that simply asserts `isA: 'Person'` and `name: 'Alice'` can use **Unit** as the subject, indicating that the envelope itself is conveying the information about a person without needing to identify a specific subject:

```
'' [
    'isA': 'foaf:Person'
    'foaf:firstName': "Wolf"
    'foaf:lastName': "McNally"
]
```

Note that the use of the subject **Unit** (`''`) here is a deliberate choice to indicate that the envelope is conveying information without a specific subject, rather than leaving the subject undefined or using a placeholder. **Unit** here conveys not that the subject is missing or unknown, but essentially that the envelope *has* and *can have* no meaningful subject other than the assertions themselves.

## Unit in the `envelope` command line tool

The `envelope` CLI tool (verion 0.31.1 and later) supports Unit as a subject type:

```
ENV=$(envelope subject type unit)
echo $ENV
envelope format $ENV

│ ur:envelope/tpsotansfzaewklngtso
│ ''
```

To build the envelope shown above, you can use the following command:

```
ENV=$( \
    envelope subject type unit | \
    envelope assertion add pred-obj known 'isA' known 'foaf:Person' | \
    envelope assertion add pred-obj known 'foaf:firstName' string "Wolf" | \
    envelope assertion add pred-obj known 'foaf:lastName' string "McNally"
)
echo $ENV

│ envelope format $ENV
│
│ ur:envelope/lrtpsotansfzaeoyadcfastyoycfaswftpsoiogtiaglhsjzjzkkoycfasvetpsoiehgjljziyghbygmec
│ '' [
│     'isA': 'foaf:Person'
│     'foaf:firstName': "Wolf"
│     'foaf:lastName': "McNally"
│ ]
```

> **Note:** The example above assumes you are using `envelope` CLI version 0.31.1 or later, and that you have installed the [JSON FOAF ontology](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/tree/master/known-value-assignments/json) in your local known values store in `~/.known-values/`.
