## Introduction

This paper addresses the need for a way to encrypt messages using best practices and encode them using [CBOR](https://cbor.io/) and [URs](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md). It specifies a general "encrypted message" structure and a specific encoding based on ChaCha20-Poly1305 Authenticated Encryption as specified in [RFC-8439](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8439).

## UR Types and CBOR Tags

This document defines the following UR types along with their corresponding CBOR tags:

| UR type        | CBOR Tag |
| :------------- | :------- |
| ur:encrypted   | #6.40002 |
| ur:crypto-key  | #6.40023 |
| ur:encrypted-key | #6.40027 |

These tags have been registered in the [IANA Registry of CBOR Tags](https://www.iana.org/assignments/cbor-tags/cbor-tags.xhtml).

### Related Work

The [COSE specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-struct/) specifies a highly general structure for the encryption and signing of messages in CBOR. There is also a need for an alternative that is simpler, more specific, more compact, and more opinionated about best practices, while still allowing for extensibility and able to serve as a component of larger structures.

## The ChaCha20-Poly1305-IETF Cipher

The [IETF variant of the ChaCha20-Poly1305](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8439) construction can encrypt a practically unlimited number of messages, but individual messages cannot exceed 64*(2^32)-64 bytes (approximately 256 GiB).

To encrypt a message, the sender provides a 32-byte symmetric key and a 12-byte nonce. The nonce is sent as part of the message, but the key is kept secret between the sender and recipient. The ChaCha20 stream cipher is used for encryption and decryption, and as part of the construction, a 16-byte authentication tag is generated using Poly1305, and is used to verify message integrity. An "additional authenticated data" field can also be provided, which is not encrypted, but it is included in the message authentication step. This field is often used to send metadata about the encrypted portion of the message. In all, the fields used and the names this document refers to them by are:

* `plaintext`: [Any length] The unencrypted message.
* `ciphertext`: [Same length as `plaintext`] The encrypted message.
* `aad`: [Any length] Additional Authenticated Data
* `key`: [32 bytes] The symmetric key.
* `nonce` [12 bytes] The nonce, which must not be repeated for the same key.
* `auth` [16 bytes] The authentication tag.

## CDDL for Encrypted Message

The following specification is written in [Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8610).

When used embedded in another CBOR structure, this structure MUST be tagged `#6.40002`. When used as the top-level object of a UR, it MUST NOT be tagged.

The general format for a Encrypted Message is a CBOR array with either 3 or 4 elements. The `aad` element is optional, but if it is present it MUST NOT be empty.

```
encrypted = [ ciphertext, nonce, auth, ? aad ];

ciphertext = bytes
nonce = bytes .size 12
auth = bytes .size 16
aad = bytes
```

### Example/Test Vector

* Test Vector from [Section 2.8.2 of RFC-8439](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8439#section-2.8.2):

plaintext: `4c616469657320616e642047656e746c656d656e206f662074686520636c617373206f66202739393a204966204920636f756c64206f6666657220796f75206f6e6c79206f6e652074697020666f7220746865206675747572652c2073756e73637265656e20776f756c642062652069742e`

```

* The structure above, as a UR:

NOTE: URs do not use CBOR tags for the top-level object. The type of the object is provided by the type field of the UR schema, in this case `encrypted`:

```

```

### Security Considerations

The security considerations for this type are the same as that for the cryptographic construction defined in [RFC-8439](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8439).

## Future Proofing

The `#6.40002` tag is intended to be extensible to other encryption constructs, if and when the need arises. The only requirement is that later constructs are distinguishable from the one defined herein, for example by inserting a distinguishing integer as the first element of the array.

### IANA Considerations

This document requests that [IANA](https://www.iana.org/assignments/cbor-tags/cbor-tags.xhtml) reserve the following tag:

| Tag | Data Item | Semantics |
|:----|:-----|:-----|
| 40002 | array | Encrypted Message |
| 40027 | tagged array | Encrypted Key |
