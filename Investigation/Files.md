# Crypto Files
The following is a discussion of files used with cryptography, covering file names, encryption security, and file formats. It's not intended as a specification, but instead a survey of current methodologies. We are seeking discussion of this and other elements related to crypto-files, to create a community specification at some point in the future.

## File Names

### Coldcard: Backup Files

[Coldcard](https://coldcard.com/) Backup Files have file name format of:

```
backup.7z
```
Coldcard Backup Files uncompress to:
```
ckcc-backup.txt
```

### Passport: Backup Files

[Passport](https://foundationdevices.com/passport/) Backup Files have file name format of:

`Master Fingerprint - "backup" - Backup #.7z`

* **Master Fingerprint** — The Hash 160 of the master public key.
* **Backup #** — The incrementing number of the backup.

**Example:**
```
604b93f2-backup-1.7z
```

Passport Backup Files uncompress to:
``passport-backup.txt``

### Gordian Seed Tool: Data Files

[Gordian Seed Tool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS) outputs a variety of individual text and image data. They follow a consistent name scheme to allow easy sorting and lookup of data.

#### Seed Data Files
The general format for a seed file name is:

`Seed Id - Seed Name - (optionally) Request or Response - Type - Format.filetype`

* **Seed ID** — The first 7 digits of the SHA256 digest of the seed.
* **Seed Name** — Randomly created or user-selected name for object. Space separated.
* **Request or Response** (optional) — Whether the file is a `ur:crypto-request` or `ur:crypto-response`.
* **Type** — The type of object, in this case, "Seed" for a Seed or "SSKR" for the shares of a Seed. 
* **Format** — Output format, including "BIP39", "ByteWords", "Hex", "Identifier-Hex", "Lifehash", "Name" or "UR". Note that URs can be encoded as plain text (with a ".txt" suffix) or a QR code (with a ".jpg" suffix). 

**Examples:**
```

ffa11a8-Yinmn Blue Acid Exam-SSKR-UR.txt
```

### SSKR Share Files

See above for SSKRs for a seed exported as a group. If SSKR shares are instead exported to individual files, per share, the format is:

`Seed Id - [Group # _ Share #] - Checksum Words - Type - Format.filetype`

* **Seed ID** — The first 7 digits of the SHA256 digest of the seed.
* **Group #** — The "group" plus the number of the share group (usually "group1").
* **Share #** — Share number "of" total shares in group.
* **Checksum Words** — Bytewords of the final four words in the share, which are checksums. Space separated.
* **Type** — The type of object, in this case "SSKR" for the shares of a Seed. 
* **Format** — Output format, including ""ByteWords" or "UR". Note that URs can be encoded as plain text (with a ".txt" suffix) or a QR code (with a ".jpg" suffix.

**Examples:**
```

* **Seed ID** — The first 7 digits of the SHA256 digest of the seed.
* **Key ID** — The first 7 digits of the SHA256 digest of the key.
* **HDKey from Seed Name** — The prefix "HDKey from" prepended to randomly created or user-selected name for seed. Space separated.
* **Request or Response** (optional) — Whether the file is a `ur:crypto-request` or `ur:crypto-response`.
* **Type** — The type of object, in this case "PrivateHDKey" or "PublicHDKey".
* **Derivation Path** — [Master Fingerprint (optionally) _ Path] _ (optionally) Fingerprint
   * **Master Fingerprint** — The Hash 160 of the master public key.
   * **Path** — The derivation path, using "h" for hardened. Underscore separated. Not used for Master Key.
   * **Fingerprint** — The Hash 160 of the derived key. Not used for Master Key.
* **Format** — Output format, including "Base58", "Detail", "Identifier-Hex", "Lifehash", "Name", or "UR". Note that URs can be encoded as plain text (with a ".txt" suffix) or a QR code (with a ".jpg" suffix).
