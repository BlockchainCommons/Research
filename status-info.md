# Research Status

Blockchain Commons Research (BCR) is labeled with one of the following statuses:

**❌❌ — withdrawn.** This BCR is only of historic interest. It was withdrawn either because it never came into use or because it came into use but proved sufficiently problematic that we do not suggest its usage in any way.

**❌ — superceded.** This BCR has been replaced with a newer BCR. We do not suggest implementing it as an output format, but you may still way to implement it as an input format to maintain backward compatibility.

**📙 — research.** This BCR has been suggested as a possible specification but has not yet received any implementations. This is a speculative specification that is being offered to the community for consideration.

**⭐️ — reference implementation.** At least one reference implementation has been released for this BCR, usually as a library, potentially with an exemplar app as well. This specification still remains very open to change because it has not yet been implemented by additional parties.

**⭐️⭐️ — multiple implementations.** There have been at least two implementations of this BCR, at least one of which is not owned by the owner of the reference implementation. This is a specification with demonstrable community support. It may still change due to the needs of the community, but only with community feedback.

**⭐️⭐️⭐️ — standards track.** A BCR, typically with at least two implementations, that is consider ready for standardization. It is being upgraded to a BIP, IETF I-D, or some other standardized format. It will typically be moved to the [BCP repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bcps). Though changes may still be made to the specification, these changes will exclusively be to allow for standardization, and will be conducted with community feedback.

**⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ — standardized.** A specification has been standardized as a BIP, an IETF standard, or some other standardized format.
