# Blockchain Commons Research

![](images/logos/bcc-research-screen.jpg)

This repository contains early-stage research of interest to the blockchain community.

Blockchain Commons Research papers (BCRs) are _not_ standards. They are fluid specifications, typically based on our own libraries or other coding. Because of their fluidity, BCRs might change without notice. If you decide to adopt a Blockchain Commons Research paper, you are becoming a Research Partner, examining how the specification might work in the real world. We look forward to working with you!

If you are using the specifications from a BCR, [please let us know](mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com). Having a BCR in usage by at least two parties other than Blockchain Commons is one of our criteria for advancing a BCR to a [Blockchain Commons Proposal (BCP)](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bcps/blob/master/README.md), increasing its stability. If you can only use a specification if it is advanced to the BCP stage, sldo let us know that, as we sometimes advance BCRs on our own if they have achieved sufficient maturity.

Generally, it's only if a BCR advances to the BCP stage that we more deeply involve community in its continued maturation and focus on it becoming an actual standard.

Please feel free to submit your own _Drafts_ of BCRs for specifications that support the creation of open, interoperable, secure & compassionate digital infrastructure to this repo as PRs, as follows.

_All contributions to this repo require a [Signed Contributor License Agreement](CLA.md) (which will be needed if we submit to other organizations like IETF, W3C, Linux Foundation, etc.)._

### BCR Number

Please number all Bitcoin Research BCRs with a four-digit number representing the current year (`YYYY`) followed by a three-digit sequence number for that year (`SSS`). For example: `bcr-2020-001` is the first BCR for 2020, `bcr-2020-017` is the 17th, and `bcr-2021-001` is the first BCR for 2021.

_Note that the sequence number reverts to 001 at the start of each year._

### BCR Title

Please be sure that your title is concise, yet informative.

### BCR Version

When updating BCRs, please use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for your version number.

Most briefly: your version number should be of the form X.Y.Z, where `X` is the major number ("0" for a BCR _Draft_; "1" for something ready to become a BCR _Work Product_; and "2" or higher for a new version that has introduced a backward-incompatible change), `Y` is the minor number (for a backward-compatible new feature), and `Z` is the patch number (for fixing typos and making other clarifications that don't fundamentally change what the BCR means).

But please consult the semantic versioning document for more information and adjust appropriately for the fact that these are textual BCRs, not software.

### BCR Owner

Please list the person primarily responsible for the BCR, and moving it forward, as the owner. If there are multiple authors, they should be listed on the BCR itself, not on this overview.

### BCR Status

   * *Draft* — The initial draft of a BCR. Contributors may work on a BCR as they see fit when it remains version 0.Y.Z. When they increment to 1.0.0, they are requested BC review.
   * *Work Product* — A major BCR or BCP draft that has been accepted by BC for further work.
   * *Promoted* — A BCR draft that has been promoted to a BCP.
   * *Deprecated* — A BCR or BCP draft that has been superseded by another specification.

### Discussions

The best place to talk about Blockchain Commons and its projects is in our GitHub Discussions areas.

[**Gordian Developer Community**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/discussions). For standards and open-source developers who want to talk about interoperable wallet specifications, please use the Discussions area of the [Gordian Developer Community repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/discussions). This is where you talk about Gordian specifications such as [Gordian Envelope](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/tree/master/Envelope#articles), [bc-shamir](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir), [Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr), and [bc-ur](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur) as well as the larger [Gordian Architecture](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Overview-Architecture.md), its [Principles](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles) of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness, and its macro-architectural ideas such as functional partition (including airgapping, the original name of this community).

[**Blockchain Commons Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions). For developers, interns, and patrons of Blockchain Commons, please use the discussions area of the [Community repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community) to talk about general Blockchain Commons issues, the intern program, or topics other than those covered by the [Gordian Developer Community](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/discussions) or the
[Gordian User Community](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions).
### Other Questions & Problems

As an open-source, open-development community, Blockchain Commons does not have the resources to provide direct support of our projects. Please consider the discussions area as a locale where you might get answers to questions. Alternatively, please use this repository's [issues](./issues) feature. Unfortunately, we can not make any promises on response time.

If your company requires support to use our projects, please feel free to contact us directly about options. We may be able to offer you a contract for support from one of our contributors, or we might be able to point you to another entity who can offer the contractual support that you need.

## Responsible Disclosure

We want to keep all of our software safe for everyone. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner. We are unfortunately not able to offer bug bounties at this time.

We do ask that you offer us good faith and use best efforts not to leak information or harm any user, their data, or our developer community. Please give us a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before you publish it. Do not defraud our users or us in the process of discovery. We promise not to bring legal action against researchers who point out a problem provided they do their best to follow the these guidelines.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected security vulnerabilities in private via email to ChristopherA@BlockchainCommons.com (do not use this email for support). Please do NOT create publicly viewable issues for suspected security vulnerabilities.

The following keys may be used to communicate sensitive information to developers:

| Name              | Fingerprint                                        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Christopher Allen | FDFE 14A5 4ECB 30FC 5D22  74EF F8D3 6C91 3574 05ED |

You can import a key by running the following command with that individual’s fingerprint: `gpg --recv-keys "<fingerprint>"` Ensure that you put quotes around fingerprints that contain spaces.
